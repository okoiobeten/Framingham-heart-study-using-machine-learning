# Heart Prediction Application

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Anaconda IDE installed on your system or Google Colab.
Ensure you have the Spyder IDE for the deployment phase.

## Getting Started

1. Open `HeartPrediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the notebook. This will generate `my_model.pkl` which contains the trained model.

2. Run `heart_prediction.py` in Spyder IDE.

3. Open Command Prompt (CMD).

4. Navigate to the folder containing your files using the following command:
   ```bash
   cd /directory/file/path/

5. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run heart_prediction.py

## Note
Ensure that Streamlit is installed. If not, you can use the following command to install it. Note that Streamlit is typically preinstalled with Anaconda, so this step may not be necessary.
```bash
pip install streamlit
